# people_api

REST API inspired by the [rinha de backend 2023](https://github.com/Tagliatti/rinha-de-backend-2023-q3/blob/main/INSTRUCOES.md) challenge.

PS: That's why the endpoints and json fields are in PT-BR.

## In progress
- [x] serialize json extractor errors as json rather than plain text
- [ ] search query optimization
- [ ] logs using `tracing`
- [ ] Dockerfile
- [ ] docker-compose building and running the application
- [ ] nginx conf
